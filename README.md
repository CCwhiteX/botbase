<h3 align="center">How to install</h3>

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/CCwhiteX/botbase.git
```

```sh
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ python3 -m pip install -r req.txt
```

We go to telegram, look for @botfather 
We write /newbot
Then you’ll figure it out, you’ll need to name your bot, set an avatar for it, and come up with a username. 
At the end we should get a token. We copy it and paste it into config.ini after =

That's it, let's launch and checking

```sh
$ python3 run.py
```
##Of course, the project is still raw, so we won’t judge it too harshly
